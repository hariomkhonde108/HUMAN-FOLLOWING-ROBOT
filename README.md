## 📌 Introduction
This Arduino-based project aims to develop a **Human-Following Robot** capable of autonomously navigating its environment while tracking a human target. With a combination of ultrasonic and infrared sensors, the robot can avoid obstacles, follow IR cues, and maintain alignment, all while being built on a lightweight acrylic chassis and powered by Li-ion batteries.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Human or object-following capabilities using ultrasonic sensing.
- Obstacle detection and avoidance.
- Line/IR following with dual IR sensors.
- Fully autonomous movement via Arduino.
- Built on a modular and expandable platform.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The ultrasonic sensor detects the human/object by measuring distance.
2. IR sensors assist in navigation and alignment on surfaces.
3. The Arduino reads sensor input and controls the motors accordingly.
4. The motor driver controls the TT gear motors to move the robot forward, backward, or turn based on sensor feedback.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements
- Add Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity.
- Use computer vision with a camera module.
- Add voice command support.
- Optimize power management for longer runtime.
